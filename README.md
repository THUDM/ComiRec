## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- TensorFlow-GPU >= 1.8 (< 2.0)
- Faiss-GPU 

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Install TensorFlow-GPU 1.x

- Install Faiss-GPU based on the instructions here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/master/INSTALL.md

- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/THUDM/ComiRec`.

### Dataset

- Original links of datasets are:

  - http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/index.html
  - https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=649&userId=1

- Two preprocessed datasets can be downloaded through: 

  - Tsinghua Cloud: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/e5c4211255bc40cba828/?dl=1
  - Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/s/m41kahhhx0a5z0u/data.tar.gz?dl=1

- You can also download the original datasets and preprocess them by yourself. You can run `python preprocess/data.py {dataset_name}` and `python preprocess/category.py {dataset_name}` to preprocess the datasets. 

### Training

#### Training on the existing datasets

You can use `python src/train.py --dataset {dataset_name} --model_type {model_name}` to train a specific model on a dataset. Other hyperparameters can be found in the code. (If you share the server with others or you want to use the specific GPU(s), you may need to set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.) 

For example, you can use `python src/train.py --dataset book --model_type ComiRec-SA` to train ComiRec-SA model on Book dataset.

When training a ComiRec-DR model, you should set `--learning_rate 0.005`. 

#### Training on your own datasets

If you want to train models on your own dataset, you should prepare the following three(or four) files:
- train/valid/test file: Each line represents an interaction, which contains three numbers `<user_id>,<item_id>,<time_stamp>`.
- category file (optional): Each line contains two numbers `<item_id>,<cate_id>` used for computing diversity..

## Common Issues

<details>
<summary>
The computation of NDCG score.
</summary>
<br/>
I'm so sorry that the computation of NDCG score in the original version (now in `paper` branch) is not consistent with the definition in the paper, as mentioned in the issue #6. 
I have updated the computation of NDCG score in the `master` branch according to the correct definition. For reproducing the NDCG scores reported in the paper, please use the `paper` branch.
By the way, I personally recommend to use the reported results of recall and hit rate only.
